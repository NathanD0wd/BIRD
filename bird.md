  **Birds Are Not Real.** Or at least around 27% of birds aren't. Have you ever seen a bird watching you a little bit *too* closely? Only to have it fly away when you start to question its motives... This is no coincedence. I am not here claiming all birds are fake or anything ridiculous like that, birds have been around for millions of years and are a key species in many environments. But not every bird you see is all it seems. I have done extensive research and much more extensive bird watching for the past 30 years of my life, and have determined that a certain portion of the birds you see in the sky are nothing more than machines.

They are placed in key locations throughout the world by governments in many different countries to monitor every human. Of course they travel with flocks of living birds to blend in. If you observe a flock of pigeons in a city you can almost always notice at least one bird that is different than the rest. Swiveling his head more than others, focusing on persons of interest, pretending to eat food, and many other suspicious activites. I have become very adept at discerning the government birds from the living ones, and I almost always have a bird following me. However, I managed to lose the birds momentatrily, so I'm rushing to get this written before they find me. I don't know how much longer I have so I'm gonna wrap this up.

Now, I want to offer you with a few of my favorite quotes from converted celebrities.
1. "I used to think birds were just innocent creatures, chirping away in the trees. But then I saw the light. I realized that they're all just part of the government's elaborate surveillance system. Now I'm a proud member of the 'Birds Aren't Real' movement, spreading the truth about these feathered fakers." -Former President Barack Obama
2. "At first I was skeptical, but then I started noticing some strange things about birds. They always seem to be watching us, and their movements are just too coordinated to be natural. That's when I discovered the truth - birds are just government drones in disguise. Join me and the 'Birds Aren't Real' movement, and together we can expose this avian conspiracy!" -Taylor Swift

And finally, before you go, here's a word of advice from leading bird expert, Marksun Drowthers. He's one of my personal friends and an amazing survivalists. Much of what I know I have learned from him. He's the best there is at avoiding detection from these nefarious feathered fiends. If you want to contact him to learn more, well that's too bad he doesn't have any contact information. But I encourage you to try and find him yourself. You'll find it quite difficult. But follow this piece of advice and you'll be golden. Never let them watch you.

> I've spent years studying the movements of birds and analyzing their behavior, and I'm here to tell you - they're not real. They're all just government drones in disguise, watching our every move. But fear not, my friends - there are ways to fight back against these avian spies. First, always wear a tinfoil hat - it'll block out their signals and keep you safe. Second, invest in a set of binoculars and scan the skies for any suspicious activity. Third, construct an underground bunker - a safe haven where you can hide from the bird drones. Finally, use an anti-drone frequency broadcaster - it'll disrupt their signals and leave them powerless. Remember, we're not alone in this fight - together, we can expose the truth and take back control. -Marksn Drowthers

Here is the link to all the research and data I have gathered over the past 25 years. Please read and learn. Thank you for staying for this long. I wish you luck on your travels throught the turmoil we call life.
